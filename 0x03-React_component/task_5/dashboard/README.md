# Task 5 - Use the New Components

This task involves modifying the `App` component to use the newly created `BodySection` and `BodySectionWithMarginBottom` components.

## Files

- `App.js`: The main React component file where the `BodySection` and `BodySectionWithMarginBottom` components are used.

## Instructions

1. Wrap the `CourseList` component with the `BodySectionWithMarginBottom` component with the title "Course list".
2. Wrap the `Login` component with the `BodySectionWithMarginBottom` component with the title "Log in to continue".
3. Add a new block with the title "News from the School" using the `BodySection` component, containing some random text.

## Requirements

- The application should function the same as before, but with the new components in place.
