# Task 2 - Handling Events in React Components

This task involves converting the Notifications function into a React Class and adding event handling for marking notifications as read.

## Files

- `Notifications.js`: The main React component file where the Notifications function is converted to a class and the `markAsRead` function is implemented.
- `NotificationItem.js`: A component that handles individual notifications and calls `markAsRead` on click.
- `Notifications.test.js`: Test file to ensure the `markAsRead` function works as expected.
- `NotificationItem.test.js`: Test file to ensure the NotificationItem component handles clicks correctly.

## Instructions

1. Convert the Notifications function to a React class.
2. Implement the `markAsRead` function.
3. Pass the `markAsRead` function to the NotificationItem component.
4. Write tests to verify the functionality.

## Requirements

- The application should function the same as before.
- No console errors or warnings.
